  ## Description:

    ***Please note that the user will need to use MySQL and have their own password that will be needed for this program***

  This is a command line interface program that allows the user to create a database of employees and track what position and department they are in, their manager, and their salary. It uses MySQL to control a database that can be updated by the user to add, update, or delete information for individuals in a company.
